# 🔐 Login & Registration System

A console-based **Login & Registration System** developed in **C++** .

The project demonstrates user registration, login authentication, duplicate username prevention, file-based data storage, password hashing with randomly generated salts, input validation, and a colorful command-line interface.

---

## ✨ Features

* 👤 **User Registration**

  * Create a new account using a username and password.
  * Supports usernames containing spaces.

* 🔑 **User Login**

  * Authenticate users using their username and password.
  * Passwords are re-hashed using the stored salt before comparison.

* 🛡️ **Salted Password Hashing**

  * Passwords are **never stored as plain text**.
  * A randomly generated salt is combined with the password before hashing.
  * Users with the same password receive different stored hash values because their salts are different.

* 🚫 **Duplicate Username Prevention**

  * Prevents registration with an existing username.

* ✅ **Input Validation**

  * Username and password cannot be empty.
  * Username cannot contain commas.
  * Password must contain at least **6 characters**.
  * Invalid menu inputs are handled safely.

* 💾 **File-Based Data Storage**

  * User information is stored locally in `user.txt`.
  * Registered users remain available after restarting the program.

* 🎨 **Colorful Console Interface**

  * Green messages for successful operations.
  * Red messages for errors.
  * Cyan headings and yellow menu display.

* 🔄 **Interactive Menu**

  * Register
  * Login
  * Exit

## 🔐 How Password Security Works

The system does **not** save the user's original password.

Instead, it generates a random salt and combines it with the password:

```text
Salt + Password
       ↓
     Hash
       ↓
Stored Password Hash
```

For example:

```text
Username: Trisha
Password: mypassword
Salt:     a7f31c92
Hash:     [generated hash value]
```

The database stores:

```text
username,salt,passwordHash
```

During login, the entered password is combined with the user's stored salt and hashed again. The newly generated hash is then compared with the stored hash.

### ⚠️ Security Note

This project uses C++ `hash` for educational purposes.

`hash` is **not a cryptographic password-hashing algorithm** and should not be used for storing passwords in a real-world production application.

For production systems, password-hashing algorithms such as **Argon2**, **bcrypt**, or **PBKDF2** should be used.
